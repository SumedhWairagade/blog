      <P>Firstly, Iâ€™d like to apolagize for the lack and timing of these posts. Iâ€™ve been busy at work and unfortunately havenâ€™t had the time to write them <span role="img" aria-label="Sob Emoji">ðŸ˜­</span>.</P>

      <P>A Javascript object is a standalone entity, with properties and types associated with it. Object properties are basically the same as javascript variables except for theyâ€™re attached to objects.</P>

      <P>You define a propterty by defining it a value, for example:</P>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcansh/49516fe25bcb4bae1213f2eda906f899.js?file=newObject.js" />

      <P>If you define a property but donâ€™t give it a value it becomes undefined, not null. e.g: <code>myCar.color;</code> would return undefined.</P>

      <P>You can also use bracket notation to iterate over all the properties of an object. e.g:</P>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcansh/49516fe25bcb4bae1213f2eda906f899.js?file=bracketNotation.js" />

      <P>You can also do if else statements with objects:</P>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcansh/49516fe25bcb4bae1213f2eda906f899.js?file=if.js" />

      <P>You can even have an object inside another object:</P>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcansh/49516fe25bcb4bae1213f2eda906f899.js?file=nestedObjects.js" />

      <P>Alternatively you can make an object with a constructor function:</P>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcansh/49516fe25bcb4bae1213f2eda906f899.js?file=constructor.js" />
    </PostContainer>
  </div>
